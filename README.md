# Personal Tech Notebooks
This is a public repository in which I take notes about the different languages and technologies I learn over time.  
The reason I have created this repository is because I learn better when I document what I learn, helping me internalize what I read, and allowing me to have an archive of information I can access or share when needed.

It also helps me practice with Markdown.
