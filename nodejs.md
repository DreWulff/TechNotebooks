# 1. What is Node.js
Official documentation: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/introduction-to-nodejs)

## Node.js

Is is an **open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment** that handles asynchronous events without creating new threads, allowing an app to manage multiple connections in a single thread.

### Summary:
* Runtime environment for JavaScript.
* Cross-platform.
* Asynchronous single-threaded behaviour.

## Javascript
Before making an app in Node.js, let's first get a quick grip on JavaScript as a language. For more details on JavaScript make sure to read my [JavaScript notebook]().

JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that was designed to work alongside HTML, allowing developers to insert lightweight scripts into HTML code. It is different from Java and more similar to Python in the sense that it does not require previous compilation before executing the code, as the engine handles all the necessary steps to execute the code when needed.

### Summary:
* Object oriented.
* Interpreted language (does not require compilation).
* Designed for webpage manipulation with HTML.
* Can be used for non-webpage related apps and serverside functionalities.
* Weakly typed.
* High-level.

# 2. Frameworks

## React
Multiplatform app UI framework for cross-platform applications.
